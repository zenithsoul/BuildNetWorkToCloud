# Building a Software-Defined Network with Open-Source Components

This case study explores the creation of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) using open-source networking components, with an emphasis on networking fundamentals, Linux, and coding. The project focuses on:

- **Back-End Development:** Utilizing Golang and Python  
- **Front-End Development:** Utilizing JavaScript for user interfaces  
- **Open Source Technologies:** Utilizing Linux namespaces, FRRouting, and GoBGP  

## My Goals: Create a Virtual Network Similar to a Cloud Network Using Open Source Tools

- How to create VPCs using Linux Bridge or Open vSwitch (OVS), namespaces, and GRE on Linux (manual/automated).
- How to create VPC peering using static routes, namespaces, and GRE on Linux (manual/automated).
- How to create VPC endpoints using static routes, namespaces, GRE, and NAT on Linux (manual/automated).
- How to create central VPC routing using dynamic routes, namespaces, and GRE on Linux (manual/automated).
- How to create central VPC routing using dynamic routes, namespaces, and MPLS L3VPN Central Service on Linux (manual/automated).

## Objectives

- Transform ideas into real-world solutions  
- Provide practical examples for aspiring Network Engineers aiming to become Network Development Engineers or Network Automation Engineers  
- Inspire the next generation of network professionals through coding, Linux, and open-source routing technologies  

## Features

- End-to-end SDN design using open-source tools  
- Implementation of MPLS VPN Layer 3, BGP, and OSPF using FRRouting and GoBGP
- Utilization of Linux Bridge and Open vSwitch (OVS) for Layer 2 networking
- Deployment of GRE, GENEVE, and VXLAN tunnels via `iproute2` to interconnect Linux namespaces
- Integration of back-end and front-end technologies  
- Real-world use cases and implementation examples
